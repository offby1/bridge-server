    Roughly: how many opponent's cards rank higher than this one?  Only look at opponents who haven't yet played to this trick.

    Examples:
    - at notrump, opening lead is the club 2, declarer & dummy have (say) six clubs.
      All six beat the club two, so our value is -6.
    - at one diamond, halfway through the hand, someone plays the 8 of spades.
      - opponents have (say) 2, 3, and ten of spades, and 3 diamonds.
      - our value is thus -1 * (1 for the ten of spades plus 3 for each diamond) == -4.
