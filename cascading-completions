We create hands in two different circumstances:

1) when a tournament starts (rather, when the signup dealine expires), we create one hand per table
2) when any hand ends, we create another hand at that same table, assuming they haven't all been already created.

Every time we create a call or a play, we need to check if the hand is complete.
Every time a hand is completed, we need to check if that tournament round (at that table) is complete.
Every time a tournament round completes, we need to check if the tournament itself is complete.
