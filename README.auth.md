I seem to have a lot of these "ideas for better django auth" files scattered all over.

- <https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/django.html>
- An "allauth" branch in this repo.  No notes though.
- A "django-passkeys" branch in this repo -- promising
- <https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
  Haven't looked into this, but it seems to not be moribund
