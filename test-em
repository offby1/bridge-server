1. Tweak `project/app/fixtures/jd-souther-is-ready-to-play-a-heart.json` by
   - setting the tempo to 0.1 second
   - setting all four "allow_bot_to_play_for_me" values to true
2. For each of the four compass directions:
   - `just fixture jd-souther-is-ready-to-play-a-heart && just --no-deps runme`
   - log in as that player
   - ensure the "Allow bot to play for me" thing is enabled, if it's visible
   - ensure developer tools console is visible
   - do `just --no-deps manage cheating_bot`
   - watch and make sure no errors appear in the console
   - maybe stop the bot
