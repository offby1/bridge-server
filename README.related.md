Some existing play-bridge-online services:

* [Bridge Base](https://www.bridgebase.com/)
  I have an account.  They offer ACBL points, which I have no interest in doing.

* [Bridgeclub Live](https://www.bridgeclublive.com/)
  Unclear if it's web-based

* [Funbridge](https://www.funbridge.com/)
  Wikipedia says it's all robots, which sounds similar to what I'm doing.

* [OK Bridge](https://www.okbridge.com/new/login.php)
  Sounds familiar. I don't have an account.

* [Realbridge](https://realbridge.online/)
  "Real Bridge with Real People", also similar to what I'm doing

* [Shark Bridge](https://www.thesharkbridgecompany.com/)
  Web site has "app downloads", but Wikipedia suggests it's online ðŸ¤·

* [Swan Games](http://www.swangames.com/main/index.html)
  Wikipedia mentions it, but the site seems to be gone.
