# Inventory of django eventstream messages that I send

This is getting confusing.  I should have a simple rule about which messages get sent when & where.

The "When" should be: "most messages correspond to the insertion of a row in the db".

New row in app_table: message, with the row's content, more or less
New row in app_calls: "
New row in app_plays: "
New row in app_hands: "
One exception: once we've determined which play won a trick, that deserves a message too, probably.

Lucky for me almost all the modifications to the db are indeed inserts of new immutable rows.  The play that wins its trick is the one exception.

## Specific to playing a hand *or* creation of a new model instance

[1] -- This is a side-effect of adding a new play (namely: the 52nd play), but doesn't *directly* correspond to an insert, in that we add lots of plays without sending this event!
[2] -- Exactly analoagous to [1] above -- this is a side-effect of adding a new call.
[6] -- I suspect this is redundant: afaict, nobody listens for this, and it seems to duplicate the event sent by models.HandManager.
