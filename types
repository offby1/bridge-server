I got a buncha types in this project *and* the library, with similar names.  Cheat sheet for converting from one to the other.

This django project:

| module     | model      |
|------------+------------|
| board      | Board      |
| handaction | Call       |
| handaction | HandAction |
| message    | Lobby      |
| message    | Message    |
| handaction | Play       |
| player     | Player     |
| seat       | Seat       |
| table      | Table      |

The bridge library:

| module   | class              |
|----------+--------------------|
| auction  | Auction            |
| contract | Bid(Call)          |
| contract | Call               |
| card     | Card               |
| contract | Contract           |
| table    | Hand               |
| xscript  | HandTranscript     |
| xscript  | Play               |
| table    | Player             |
| auction  | PlayerCall         |
| card     | Rank(enum.IntEnum) |
| xscript  | Score              |
| seat     | Seat(enum.Enum)    |
| card     | Suit(enum.IntEnum) |
| table    | Table              |
| xscript  | Trick              |

Let's do one example:

    AssertionError: I want a <class 'bridge.table.Table'> but you done gimme a <class 'app.models.table.Table'>

model Table => library Table
model Table has four seats, and a buncha handactions.
library Table has a dict mapping library Seats to library Players.
   library Seat (int enum)
   library Player is a library Seat(!), a name (str), and a library Hand
   library Hand is a list of library Card
   library Card is a Suit (int enum) and a Rank (int enum)

ok those seem reasonably close.
