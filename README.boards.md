I'd like a page, or pages, to display the results of a given board, across all tables.

Maybe one "list" page that links to summary pages.  The entries would display only the public info about the board -- number, vulnerabilities, and dealer; in particular, no cards and no scores.

    Although maybe it'd show scores, if the viewer has already played this board.

Each summary page:

- is something like a 403 if the viewer has never played that board; or else
- a list of tables that have played it, and the outcome for each
- each entry would of course be a link to the corresponding hand archive page
- perhaps order this list by the scores of the players at the same seat as the viewer.  That is:
  - we've already determined that the viewer has already played this board; so
  - what seat (or really, which partnership) was the viewer in? Let's say it's N/S
  - so order the entries by the N/S score, and highlight the entry for the viewer.  That's a very rough estimate of how well they did on this board: maybe they're at the top, or the bottom, or somewhere in between.
