What tools do my various projects (mostly the bridge server) use?

Once I list most of them, I should study each to see if there are features I don't yet know about that I could be using.

- bash
- chrome's developer tools
  - the performance stuff is intriguing.
- coverage
- curl
- daphne
- django
- django-eventstream
  - I've never found really good documentation that would answer the following questions.
  - it's not clear how I can get the current message ID for a given channel, now that I'm using Redis for persistence.
  - it's not clear what I'm supposed to do with them once I get them.  (I used to send them to the bots, so they could send them back when they started listening; but I've gotten rid of the bots.)
    - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/686efd4a-eddc-8013-a276-b5e76bc9a4a0) tells me:

      Why no API [to fetch a channel's current event ID from Redis]?
      The likely reasons:

      * The intended abstraction is: “Clients track their own Last-Event-ID, and the server just serves events ≥ that ID.”

      * Server-side querying of Redis events is considered an implementation detail (since Redis is assumed ephemeral).

      * The library’s main use case is to serve streams to clients, not to expose event-history APIs to server code.

  - It's not clear what I'm supposed to do with events whose type is something other than "message" -- "keep-alive" I imagine I just ignore, but wtf is "stream-reset"?
  - ChatGPS above gave a reasonable answer: -- "stream-reset" means the client should drop its connection, forget about any saved event ID, and create a new connection.
- docker
- emacs:flycheck
- emacs:lsp
- git
- htmx
- ipython
- just
- mypy
  I'm trying daemon mode.
- orbstack
- postgres
- prometheus, grafana, &c
- pytest
- ruff
  I've never figured out how to get it to sort imports.
- uv
- zsh

Geez, that's a lot
