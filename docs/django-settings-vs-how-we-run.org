* Intro

Thinking about

- clearly separating "which django settings do we use" from "which processes run, and where, and how"
- which combinations of those things exist, and what are they for

| proposed justfile recipe name | django settings flavor | how we run it        | description                                      |

| botme                         | dev                    | local docker         | like the above, but we need the bots running     |

Note that there's no law saying I must have exactly two sets of django settings; any number greater than 0 could theoretically work.
* How do the "dev" django settings differ from the "prod" ones?
These observations are based on commits on main, before this one

** ~DEBUG~ is True in dev; False in prod

** Both set ~DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT~ (to either ~"production"~ or ~"staging"~) based on the ~COMPOSE_PROFILES~ environment variable
To state the obvious: ~DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT~ here is exactly my "how we run it" column above.
- Maybe nix this variable entirely, and rely on https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/envvars/#compose_profiles

** logging level depends on ~DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT~.
But I dunno, maybe it should depend simply on dev vs prod.

** Sentry only works in "prod".
... and I sometimes wish it worked in dev.

** only "dev" allows pyinstrument to be activated.
It still requires ~PYINSTRUMENT~ to be set to ~t~ in the envronment.

** I adjust various log levels to non-defaults in "dev"
