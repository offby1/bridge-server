It *seems* (although I haven't proven) that somehow I created a table with no hands.

I'm trying to contrive a way to make that happen, so I can write a test and fix it.

How might I reproduce this?

I've got to create a table with no hands, duh.

Maybe start with table.details.new_table_for_two_partnerships:
That calls app.models.Table.objects.create_with_two_partnerships
That calls t.next_board
That will return None if
- if self.tournament.is_complete; or
- self.find_unplayed_board() itself returns None
