OK, so how do I take a server full of users and bots, most of whom are in the lobby, and put them to work stressing the server?

Just running "big_bot_stress" doesn't do it, because that only activates *seated* players, and we have too few of those.

I assume I gotta

* create a new tournament
* get all the players signed up into it
* set the signup deadline to now
* *then* turn the bots on (and speed up all the tables)
