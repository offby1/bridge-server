OK, so how do I take a server full of users and bots, most of whom are in the lobby, and put them to work stressing the server?

Just running "big_bot_stress" doesn't do it, because that only activates *seated* players, and we have too few of those.

So:

* load up a db with a bunch of players: `just restore < something-backed-up-from-prod-recently-ish`
* start things in docker-land: `just follow`
* create a new tournament
  - you can do this through the web site at http://localhost:9000/tournament/
* get all the players signed up into it
  - `t = Tournament.objects.get(pk=6)` for some value of "6", of course
  - `[t.sign_up(p) for p in Player.objects.filter(currently_seated=False).filter(partner__currently_seated=False).all()]`
* set the signup deadline to now
  - you can do this through the admin page -- http://localhost:9000/admin/app/tournament/6/change/
* *then* run big_bot_stress
