# What to monitor and how

I don't yet know what I need from monitoring.

I have a branch that adds prometheus and grafana; iirc they work fine there.  I haven't bothered merging it into main.

I also have a branch where I'm poking at fluentd for log collection.

I just came across [opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/demo/), and it is awfully slick.  Seems to solve the same problems as prometheus *and* fluentd, all bundled together.
