STILL TODO:

DONE:

* the "lookin' for love" dropdown is always set to "unknown" when the page loads, even if a filter is in effect.
  E.g. <http://localhost:8000/players/?&lookin_for_love=true> correctly displays only partner-ess players, but the dropdown shows "Unknown" when it should show "yes".

  Dunno what I did to fix this, really, apart from making it a lot simpler
