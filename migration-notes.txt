OK, to do this right I think I gotta

1: * create a new column in Seat called something like "direction_letter", defined as CharField.   Similarly for the Board.dealer column
2: * do a data migration to populate those new columns
3: * now add the constraints to the new columns
4: * reapply all the code changes, including replacing the original columns with the new ones

As a check -- the end result should be the same code as

    Maaaany tweaks to accomodate seats being letters, not numbers

    I need to change this, though, from a single migration, to a series of migrations -- one of which is a data migration

except for some extra migration files, and of course the tests should all pass.
