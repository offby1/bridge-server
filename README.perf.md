# Perf notes

## pyinstrument

This is the nicest profiler I've found so far.  I can use it in two ways; both are enabled by setting `PYINSTRUMENT` to `t` in the environment.

* `just test` will run the unit tests as usual, but when they're done, it'll spew a cute text-mode call graph showing which functions took how long.

* `just runme` will work normally, but you can append `?profile` to any URL, and it'll render a slick flamegraph, instead of the usual page content.

## py-spy

I once managed to get py-spy working on MacOS (it wasn't easy); I have not been able to reproduce this success.  It works fine in the docker container, though.  I think I use it there like this:

```shell
$ docker compose exec -it django bash
# htop # to find out the PID you care about
# poetry run py-spy --attach PID
```
