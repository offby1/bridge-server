# Perf notes

## pytest-profiling
Just run `just t --profile-svg`, and it'll run the tests and collect profile data; then you can open an SVG page (whose path will be displayed) to see a complex graph that shows who calls whom and how long it takes, &c.
## py-spy

I once managed to get py-spy working on MacOS (it wasn't easy); I have not been able to reproduce this success.  It works fine in the docker container, though.
