# Perf notes

## py-spy

I once managed to get py-spy working (it wasn't easy); I have not been able to reproduce this success.

I tried to run py-spy, but

* that requires root on MacOS (my development platform of choice)
* I couldn't figure out how to get it working via "sudo"
* I wound up using orbstack's "machine" like this:

  * `git clone /Users/not-workme/git-repositories/me/bridge/server bridge-server`
  * `cd bridge-server/project`
  * `py-spy record --subprocesses poetry run pytest`

I seem to recall things failing mysteriously until I manually accepted the gitlab SSH server's "fingerprint":

    $ ssh git@gitlab.com
    The authenticity of host 'gitlab.com (172.65.251.78)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:eUXGGm1YGsMAS7vkcx6JOJdOGHPem5gQp4taiCfCLB8.
    This key is not known by any other names
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'gitlab.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

â€¦ [google](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-teensy-info-tail571dc2-ts-net/7cmlfztwtz?form_factor=mobile) suggests that the problem is the debug toolbar!
  That's good news, since it sounds like I'll speed things up by making some prod settings that don't include it, which should be easy.
