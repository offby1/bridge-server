The bot proper seems to be ok, but the interactive view web page often shows the hand as it was a few calls or plays ago, and won't update when I hit F5.

Once when I was in that situation, I opened a new tab and went to /serialzed/hand/whatever, and that showed reasonable-looking results; and then the older tab updated (either on its own, or after I hit f5; can't remember).
