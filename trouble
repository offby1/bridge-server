I'm allowed to see the cards played in this trick, yet I haven't yet *completed* playing this hand.

I.e., This page is showing me that North has the ace of clubs, and South has the ace of Hearts; I shouldn't be able to know that!!

I suspect I'm conflating "played a hand completely (and hence saw all 52 cards)" with "started playing a hand, and hence saw my own cards".
