https://bridge.offby1.info/players/?seated=False shows that I (bob) can "table up" with james and mark.

But when I click the button, I see `Tournaments [] are over; no more boards`

It should have created a new tournament for us.

`maybe_new_tournament` is certainly not doing what it's s'posed to (see `iTerm2 Session Jan 23, 2025 at 11:41:23â€¯AM.txt`):

* when it works successfully, oy, so many queries! I mean maybe this isn't the end of the world; it's not going to get called all that often.  But still.
* more importantly: when run twice in a row, it happily makes a second tournament!  (Albeit, oddly, without all the queries)
