On the main branch, in the shell, with a few tables in various states:

- `t = Table.objects.get(pk=23)`

  Just one obvious query.

- `t.current_hand`

  160(!) queries, many of them UPDATE
  ```
     53 SELECT "app_play"."id",
     52 UPDATE "app_play"
     52 SELECT "app_call"."id",
  ```

  clearly we're walking along each call and each play.

- similarly `Hand.objects.get(pk=23)`

- fetching just a single play is, happily, less painful, but still:
  - we're doing `SELECT FROM app_play` twice
  - we're doing the `UPDATE` every time
