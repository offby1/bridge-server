  (happily, the bidding-box's background is correct)

I think it's because, in `hand-div.html`, we have at the top

    <div id="{{ id }}" class="{% if id == active_seat %}active{% endif %}">

and as it happens, `id` is empty, and `active_seat` is also empty.

Now: what should `id` be in this case, and what should `active_seat` be in this case? ðŸ¤”
