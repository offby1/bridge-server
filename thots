Start with:
-------
One board per tournament.
Two tables (i.e., 8 players), all seated, none have yet called or played.
One table is still playing.
The other table finishes.  The question is: what should happen when one of those players click "next board plz"

Another question: when should we create a new tournament:
* When someone clicks "Next Board", and that tournament is found to be complete; or maybe
* When someone makes the 52nd play in some hand, that turns out to be the final hand in that tournament

Uh oh!

$ just drop migrate manage loaddata now_what
$ just --no-deps runme
- sign up as new player, e.g. "n2"
- find partner, table up
- go to http://localhost:9000/hand/1/

I'm allowed to see the cards played in this trick, yet I haven't yet *completed* playing this hand.  I.e., I now know that North has the ace of clubs, and South has the ace of Hearts.

I suspect I'm conflating "played a hand completely (and hence saw all 52 cards)" with "started playing a hand, and hence saw my own cards".
