Who knows, maybe I can do it all with some JS in the browser.

# First

Just look at the existing thing.

- `just tiny`
- twiddle thumbs until http://localhost:9000/hand/ shows four complete hands (why does it take so long?)
- `docker compose stop bot`
- hack stuff by hand:
  - in the django shell:
```
h2 = Hand.objects.get(pk=2)
h2.play_set.all().delete()
h2.call_set.all().delete()
h2.is_complete = False
h2.save()
h2.board.tournament.completed_at = None
h2.board.tournament.save()
from app.models.common import attribute_names
for attr in attribute_names:
    getattr(h2, attr).current_hand = None;
    getattr(h2, attr).save()
cache.clear()
```

  - in pgadmin4:
    - change user 2's name to "bob"
    - change corresponding player (namely, 1): "synthetic" => false; "allow_bot_to_play_for_me" => true
  - `just manage changepassword bob`
  - `just backup`
  - hack the backup file and scoot the play completion deadline into the future
  - `just restore <` the-backup-file
  - `just dumpdata` ; save that as `project/app/fixtures/four-hands.json`
- `just --no-deps runme`
- log in as bob, look at h2
- `docker compose start bot`
- as *those* players play, the hand should update.
