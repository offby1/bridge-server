Start with:
-------
One board per tournament.
Two tables (i.e., 8 players), all seated, none have yet called or played.
One table is still playing.
The other table finishes.  The question is: what should happen when one of those players click "next board plz"

Another question: when should we create a new tournament:
* When someone clicks "Next Board", and that tournament is found to be complete; or maybe
* When someone makes the 52nd play in some hand, that turns out to be the final hand in that tournament
