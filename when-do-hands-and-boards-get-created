1) when a tournament round starts:
   - we create all boards for all tables in that round
   - we create one hand per table with those newly-created boards
2) when any of those hands ends:
   - if all the other hands in the round have also ended:
     - if the tournament is over:
       - eject all pairs
       - send suitable SSE event
     - otherwise:
       - start a new tournament round
   - otherwise:
     - if there are unplayed boards for this table & round:
       - we create another hand at that same table, using the next board for this table & round
     - otherwise:
       - do nothing for this table
