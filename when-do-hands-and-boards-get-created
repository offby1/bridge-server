when a tournament signup deadline expires (i.e., when we first know exactly who the players are):
- we create all the boards, grouped by round number

when a tournament round starts:
- (ensure boards for this round exist)
- (ensure no incomplete hands exist)
- we create one hand per table, using the boards for that round

when any of those hands ends:
- if all the other hands in the round have also ended:
  - if the tournament is over:
    - eject all pairs
    - send suitable SSE event
  - otherwise:
    - start a new tournament round (item #1 above)
- otherwise:
  - if there are unplayed boards for this table & round ("test_first_hand_to_end_in_a_round"):
    - we create another hand at that same table, using the next board for this table & round
  - otherwise ("test_last_hand_in_a_group"):
    - do nothing for this table
