# Oh no

The usual `just drop dcu -d && just stress --min-players=20` created a tournament of 15
hands per round, but things just stopped happening after 12 hands.  Haven't yet figured out why.

Looks like some bots are down when they should be up, and we're just sitting around waiting for them.

The bots seem to play just fine in the first round; but when the second round starts, at least some -- perhaps the ones that moved to new tables -- either don't start, or if they do start, they never "hear" any events, so they don't do anything.

## A clue?

In one case, I saw that it was _d'angelo -- player PK 18 -- who had gone AWOL.

His bot process was up, but lookit this

```
root@c3b54967b578 /service
‚ùØ svstat *
10: up (pid 8768) 291 seconds
17: up (pid 8767) 291 seconds
18: unable to open supervise/ok: file does not exist
3: unable to open supervise/ok: file does not exist
9: up (pid 8769) 291 seconds
daphne: up (pid 30) 532 seconds
```

The `ok` file, when it exists, is a named pipe.  Haven't yet figured out what its use is for daemontools.

## It might be easier ...

... to reason about whether the bot should be up or not if we change the rule to "the bot is down when `allow_bot_to_play_for_me` is `False`, and up otherwise"; in particular, it doesn't matter if the relevant player is seated

And it might be easier to enforce that if, instead of having calls to `_control_bot` scattered hither and thither, I used a signal, or a post-commit hook, or something like that, to check if that field changed
